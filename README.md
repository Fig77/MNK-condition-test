### About The Project

The project consists of an algorithm practice for generating and checking conditions on an MMK board on constant time.

### Built With

This project was built using Ruby.

### Prerequisites
 The development environment uses `Ruby`, hence install ruby before proceeding.
  - Mac OS - `brew install ruby`
  - Linux - `sudo apt-get install ruby-full`
  - windows - Download Ruby Installer [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/), run it, and you are done!
  
## Installation and set-up
1. You can download the zip project clicking [here](https://github.com/Fig77/MNK-condition-test/archive.developer.zip) or you can clone the project using the command - git clone <https://github.com/Fig77/MNK-condition-test.git> 
2. If you are in windows, just navigate to the tic-tac-toe folder/bin and click on main to start the game. On Linux, navigate with console using [cd command](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) and then write `ruby bin/main.rb`
